h2. Gedit-Rails

This package provides some helpful plugins and language definitions, for developing ruby and ruby on rails applications with gedit, the default gtk text/source editor.  While gedit, in it's default state, is a very vanilla text editor, it can be extended through plugins, written either in Python or C, making it a very simple but powerful development environment.

After cloning this repo, simply run the provided install.sh script, and the plugins and language definitions will be applied for you.

One other thing I would suggest, you can get emacs like navigation keys by setting desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme to "Emacs" in gconf.

If you have a particular plugin, snippet, or any other configuration tweak, you find helpful in transforming gedit into a ruby development environment, please fork this repository and contribute.
