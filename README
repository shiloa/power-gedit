This repo is based on 2 quite excellent repositories by Matthew Swasey (http://github.com/mig), 
that combined themes and plugins/language files for gnome's gedit text editor, mostly so that I
could quickly setup a gedit on a new machine.

In addition, I added an apt-get line to install 'pretty' monospaced fonts, but you can remove it safely.
This font setup is commented by default, so remove the comment in the setup file to activate it.

All credit is due to Mr. Swasey, of course. All I did is clone and combined these repos, and 
added some plugins and langs I found along the way. I re-wrote the setup file in ruby,
mostly to resolve file permissions that prevented the new additions from appearing in gedit.

Install:
--------
run setup.rb as root from it's directory - 
$ sudo ruby setup.rb

OR

$ sudo chmod +x setup.rb
$ sudo ./setup.rb


Configure:
----------
(restart gedit if running)
In gedit, go to Edit > Preferences
* configure fonts and themes on Font & Colors tab.
* configure pluggins on the Plugins tab.
* configure snippets under Tools > Manage Snippets... menu
