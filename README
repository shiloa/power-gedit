This repo is based on 2 quite excellent repositories by Matthew Swasey (http://github.com/mig), 
that combined themes and plugins/language files for gnome's gedit text editor, mostly so that I
could quickly setup a gedit on a new machine.

In addition, I added an apt-get line to install 'pretty' monospaced fonts, but you can remove it safely.

All credit is due to Mr. Swasey, of course. All I did is clone and combined these repos, and 
added some plugins and langs I found along the way. Some changes were added to the install.sh,
mostly to resolve file permissions that prevented the new additions from appearing in gedit.

Install:
--------
run install.sh as root from it's directory - 
power-gedit~$ sudo ./install.sh

Configure:
----------
In gedit, go to Edit > Preferences
* configure fonts and themes on Font & Colors tab.
* configure pluggins on the Plugins tab.
* configure snippets under Tools > Manage Snippets... menu
